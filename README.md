Originally developed by [MaximumADHD](https://github.com/MaximumADHD), This project serves as a continuation of the original [Rbx2Source](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Rbx2Source) Project.

# Setup
- Download the latest [Rbx2Source.exe](https://github.com/LockpickInteractive/Rbx2Source/raw/main/Rbx2Source.exe) file from the github page. 
- Alternatively, download the latest build artifact from the last commit.      
- If your Source Games are on a drive other than C:, you must create a config.txt file next to Rbx2Source.
- [Here's an example of a good config.txt file](https://github.com/LockpickInteractive/Rbx2Source/raw/main/config.example.txt)
- If you're having issues, try running the [Cache Clearer](https://github.com/LockpickInteractive/Rbx2Source/raw/main/Clear%20Cache.bat).  If that doesn't fix anything, create a github issue.

# Building Instructions
- Clone the github repository.
- Clone [This repository](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-File-Format/) as well.
